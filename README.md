Navigate to the folder:
open terminal: 
    Run the program:
        python main.py

## 🧠 How It Works
- The game uses a 3x3 grid of Tkinter buttons
- Each move updates the internal state
- The program checks:
   - Rows
   - Columns
   - Diagonals
- If a winner is found:
   - Winning cells are highlighted
   - Score is updated
   - Board resets automatically
- The project follows a structured OOP design:
- create_widgets() → UI setup
- on_click() → Move handling
- check_winner() → Win detection
- update_score() → Score management
- reset_board() → Game reset

- 🎚 Difficulty Levels
- 🌈 Theme Toggle (Dark / Light Mode)
- 🔊 Sound Effects
- 🎯 Turn Indicator Label
- 🧩 Custom Board Sizes (4x4, 5x5)
- 🎓 Learning Outcomes
