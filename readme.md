🧠 How It Works
The game uses a 3x3 grid of Tkinter buttons
Each move updates the internal state
The program checks:
Rows
Columns
Diagonals
If a winner is found:
Winning cells are highlighted
Score is updated
Board resets automatically
The project follows a structured OOP design:
create_widgets() → UI setup
on_click() → Move handling
check_winner() → Win detection
update_score() → Score management
reset_board() → Game reset
